"I think there's a world market for about 5 computers." "It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years.

"No one is so old as those who have outlived enthusiasm." "Forty is the old age of youth; fifty is the youth of old age." "The old believe everything: the middle-aged suspect everything: the young know everything." "Life's tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late."

"Anger repressed can poison a relationship as surely as the cruelest words." "Beauty, without expression, tires." "It is amazing how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness." "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." "I'm tired of all the nonsense about beauty being only skin-deep. That's deep enough. What do you want – an adorable pancreas?" "Everything has its beauty, but not everyone sees it." "Some people, no matter how old they get, never lose their beauty – they merely move it from their faces into their hearts." "It is not beauty that endears; it's love that makes us see beauty." "Beauty is only skin deep, but ugly goes clean to the bone." "You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else." "Beauty is whatever gives joy." "A business absolutely devoted to service will have only one worry about profits. They will be embarrassingly large." "By working faithfully eight hours a day you may eventually get to be boss and work twelve hours a day." "Never burn bridges. Today's junior jerk, tomorrow's senior partner." "The secret of business is to know something that nobody else knows." "It is difficult, but not impossible, to conduct strictly honest business." "If your business keeps you so busy that you have no time for anything else, there must be something wrong either with you or with your business." "If you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work." "A real entrepreneur is somebody who has no safety net underneath them." "Good products can be sold by honest advertising. If you don't think the product is good, you have no business to be advertising it." "Drive your business. Let not your business drive you." "You must be the change you wish to see in the world." "The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude." "The only thing constant in life is change." "He who rejects change is the architect of decay. The only human institution which rejects progress is the cemetery." "Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything." "Consider how hard it is to change yourself and you'll understand what little chance you have in trying to change others." "No change of circumstances can repair a defect of character." "It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change." "Only the wisest and stupidest of men never change." "Change the changeable, accept the unchangeable, and remove yourself from the unacceptable." "Adults are always asking little kids what they want to be when they grow up 'cause they're looking for ideas." "Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them." "Don't handicap your children by making their lives easy." "There's nothing that can help you understand your beliefs more than trying to explain them to an inquisitive child." "Pretty much all the honest truth telling in the world is done by children." "We worry about what a child will be tomorrow, yet we forget that he is someone today." "We cannot always build the future of our youth, but we can build our youth for the future." "Children are our most valuable resource." "Never underestimate a child's ability to get into more trouble." "Always be nice to your children because they are the ones who will choose your rest home." "It takes courage to grow up and turn out to be who you really are." "Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak. Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen." "Courage is grace under pressure." "Courage is being scared to death but saddling up anyway." "It is curious that physical courage should be so common in the world and moral courage so rare." "Courage is not the absence of fear but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear." "Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them." "Success is never final. Failure is never fatal. It's courage that counts." "Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says ‘I'll try again tomorrow.'" "Faced with what is right, to leave it undone shows a lack of courage." "In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes." "Even death is not to be feared by one who has lived wisely." "Our death is not an end if we can live on in our children and the younger generation. For they are us, our bodies are only wilted leaves on the tree of life." "The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated." "The only difference between death and taxes is that death doesn't get worse every time Congress meets." "As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death." "The boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?" "Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily." "The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time." "No one knows whether death, which people fear to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good." "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it." "Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't." "The only true wisdom is knowing that you know nothing." "To repeat what others have said requires education. To challenge it requires brains." "It is possible to store the mind with a million facts and still be entirely uneducated." "Life is not divided into semesters. You don't get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself." "Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death." "Education is like a double-edged sword. It may be turned to dangerous uses if it is not properly handled." "Ignorance, the root and the stem of every evil." "Education's purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one." "The only stable state is the one in which all men are equal before the law." "Democracy does not guarantee equality of conditions. It only guarantees equality of opportunity." "As many political writers have pointed out, commitment to political equality is not an empirical claim that people are clones." "All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others." "I believe in equality for everyone, except reporters and photographers." "Before God we are all equally wise – and equally foolish." "Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it." "The sole equality on earth is death." "To live anywhere in the world today and be against equality because of race or color is like living in Alaska and being against snow." "Unless man is committed to the belief that all mankind are his brothers, then he labors in vain and hypocritically in the vineyards of equality." "The only rock I know that stays steady, the only institution I know that works is the family." "Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city." "A happy family is but an earlier heaven." "You know the only people who are always sure about the proper way to raise children? Those who've never had any." "Family isn't about whose blood you have. It's about who you care about." "All happy families resemble one another. Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." "Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family. Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one." "You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them." "As the family goes, so goes the nation and so goes the whole world in which we live." "If you cannot get rid of the family skeleton, you may as well make it dance." "Don't walk in front of me, I may not follow. Don't walk behind me, I may not lead. Walk beside me and be my friend." "Misfortune shows those who are not really friends." "Your friend is the man who knows all about you and still likes you." "You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you." "True friends stab you in the front." "Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light." "I destroy my enemies when I make them my friends." "Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art… It has no survival value. Rather it is one of those things that give value to survival." "There are no strangers here; Only friends you haven't yet met." "Wear a smile and have friends; wear a scowl and have wrinkles." "Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be." "Happiness is a butterfly which, when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you." "The best way to cheer yourself up is to cheer somebody else up." "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." "It is very important to generate a good attitude, a good heart, as much as possible. From this, happiness in both the short term and the long term for both yourself and others will come." "Happiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length." "Happiness is not a goal; it is a by-product." "Happiness comes of the capacity to feel deeply, to enjoy simply, to think freely, to risk life, to be needed." "The U.S. Constitution doesn't guarantee happiness, only the pursuit of it. You have to catch up with it yourself." "Happiness is nothing more than good health and a bad memory." "Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much." "There's so much comedy on television. Does that cause comedy in the streets?" "Never be afraid to laugh at yourself. After all, you could be missing out on the joke of the century." "That is the saving grace of humor. If you fail no one is laughing at you." "Humor is perhaps a sense of intellectual perspective: an awareness that some things are really important, others not; and that the two kinds are most oddly jumbled in everyday affairs." "Life is tough, and if you have the ability to laugh at it you have the ability to enjoy it." "The best jokes are dangerous, and dangerous because they are in some way truthful." "Analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog. Few people are interested and the frog dies of it." "You are not angry with people when you laugh at them. Humor teaches tolerance." "I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it." "Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies." "Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own." "Love is friendship, set on fire." "Love doesn't make the world go round; love is what makes the ride worthwhile." "It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages." "Love is, above all else, the gift of oneself." "Love at first sight is easy to understand; it's when two people have been looking at each other for a lifetime that it becomes a miracle." "Love is the irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired." "Friendship may, and often does, grow into love, but love never subsides into friendship." "Love is like a virus. It can happen to anybody at any time." "A diplomat is a man who always remembers a woman's birthday but never remembers her age." "Women marry men hoping they will change. Men marry women hoping they will not. So each is inevitably disappointed." "Men are what their mothers made them." "Male and female represent the two sides of the great radical dualism. But in fact they are perpetually passing into one another. Fluid hardens to solid, solid rushes to fluid. There is no wholly masculine man, no purely feminine woman." "If women are expected to do the same work as men, we must teach them the same things." "For most of history, ‘Anonymous' was a woman." "Women are made to be loved, not understood." "There are three kinds of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who learn by observation. The rest of them have to pee on the electric fence for themselves." "Women don't want to hear what you think. Women want to hear what they think – in a deeper voice." "Women who seek to be equal with men lack ambition." "Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first." "I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful." "A bank is a place where they lend you an umbrella in fair weather and ask for it back when it begins to rain." "Money won't create success. The freedom to make it will." "Money isn't the most important thing in life, but it's reasonably close to oxygen on the ‘gotta have it' scale." "Time is money." "If you're given a choice between money and sex appeal, take the money. As you get older, the money will become your sex appeal." "It is the wretchedness of being rich that you have to live with rich people." "The only way not to think about money is to have a great deal of it." "I think that much of the advice given to young men about saving money is wrong. I never saved a cent until I was forty years old. I invested in myself – in study, in mastering my tools, in preparation. Many a man who is putting a few dollars a week into the bank would do much better to put it into himself." "This film cost $31 million. With that kind of money I could have invaded some country." "All of life's riddles are answered in the movies." "A good film script should be able to do completely without dialogue." "Shoot a few scenes out of focus. I want to win the foreign film award." "The best reason to make a film is that you feel passionately about it." "A film has its own life and takes its own time." "Movies can and do have tremendous influence in shaping young lives in the realm of entertainment towards the ideals and objectives of normal adulthood." "The average Hollywood film star's ambition is to be admired by an American, courted by an Italian, married to an Englishman, and have a French boyfriend." "In the theater, you go from point A to point Z, building your performance as the evening progresses. You have to relinquish that control on a film." "Every great film should seem new every time you see it." "Opera is when a guy gets stabbed in the back and, instead of bleeding, he sings." "Music is the wine that fills the cup of silence." "Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything." "Life is one grand, sweet song so start the music." "Nothing separates the generations more than music. By the time a child is eight or nine, he has developed a passion for his own music that is even stronger than his passions for procrastination and weird clothes." "Of all noises, I think music is the least disagreeable." "Music in the soul can be heard by the universe." "I don't know anything about music. In my line you don't have to." "Music is a safe kind of high." "Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent." "If everyone demanded peace instead of another television set, then there'd be peace." "Peace begins with a smile." "Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding." "Peace is its own reward." "If you want to make peace, you don't talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies." "The only alternative to coexistence is codestruction." "Fighting for peace is like screwing for virginity." "Where ignorance is our master, there is no possibility of real peace." "Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without." "It isn't enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isn't enough to believe in it. One must work at it." "One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors." "Politics is such a torment that I advise everyone I love not to mix with it." "I have come to the conclusion that politics are too serious a matter to be left to the politicians." "Being in politics is like being a football coach. You have to be smart enough to understand the game, and dumb enough to think it's important." "Politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow, next week, next month and next year and to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didn't happen." "The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary." "I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain." "Politics have no relation to morals." "Politics is not the art of the possible. It consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable." "It has been said that politics is the second oldest profession. I have learned that it bears a striking resemblance to the first." "Science may set limits to knowledge, but should not set limits to imagination." "Science never solves a problem without creating ten more." "Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science." "There are in fact two things, science and opinion; the former begets knowledge, the latter ignorance." "The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom." "The important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as to discover new ways of thinking about them." "New discoveries in science will continue to create a thousand new frontiers for those who still would adventure." "However far modern science and techniques have fallen short of their inherent possibilities, they have taught mankind at least one lesson; nothing is impossible." "I am among those who think that science has great beauty. A scientist in his laboratory is not only a technician: he is also a child placed before natural phenomena which impress him like a fairy tale." "Science is simply common sense at its best. That is, rigidly accurate in observation, and merciless to fallacy in logic." "Sports do not build character. They reveal it." "Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence. In other words, it is war minus the shooting." "We didn't lose the game; we just ran out of time." "I went to a fight last night and a hockey game broke out." "Sports serve society by providing vivid examples of excellence." "You can't win unless you learn how to lose." "Winners never quit and quitters never win." "Sport is imposing order on what was chaos." "The difference between the old ballplayer and the new ballplayer is the jersey. The old ballplayer cared about the name on the front. The new ballplayer cares about the name on the back." "The breakfast of champions is not cereal, it's the opposition." "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently." "Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." "I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody." "Eighty percent of success is showing up." "Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today." "You can do anything, but not everything." "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but a habit." "The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure." "Opportunity is missed by most people, because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work." "Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it." "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones." "May God have mercy upon my enemies, because I won't." "You can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake." "There never was a good war or a bad peace." "What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless whether the mad destruction is brought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy?" "There is no glory in battle worth the blood it costs." "It is well that war is so terrible – otherwise we would grow too fond of it." "War is a cowardly escape from the problems of peace." "Civil war? What does that mean? Is there any foreign war? Isn't every war fought between men, between brothers?" "My first wish is to see this plague of mankind, war, banished from the earth." "That which doesn't kill us makes us stronger." "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent." "Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right." "If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard enough problems." "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise." "We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools." "The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails." "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration." "I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it." "You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time. But you cannot fool all of the people all of the time."]}
